## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was pretty excited to test the new css nesting feature, so I decided to start get comfortable with it an its differences from other pre-processor nesting. Also once again mobile first was incredible, this time no change was need it for the code to work in both mobiles and desktops.

### Continued development

I tried estimiting how much I would take me to complete the challenge. My initial guess was 1 hours, but I took a little bit more than the double. So it's a future improvement: get better at estimiting my work.
